155,Papillon Restaurant,Abuja Photos,"I never pass up an opportunity to try breakfast at any location, (being that it's my favourite meal of the day); especially if it's a buffet setting. Papillon is a restaurant I have very pleasant memories of. I once stayed at the hotel it's located in for a couple of weeks with some dear family friends back in the 1990s. I think I dined here once or twice over the years, but haven't been back in a really long time, so this was an experience that I pre-planned and eagerly looked forward to. I had no idea that the hotel's name had changed from SHERATON HOTEL to ABUJA CONTINENTAL HOTEL! 😮 Was surprised and a little dismayed to see that, because Sheraton Hotel has been an iconic Abuja Hotel for a great many number of years. 😔 The former Sheraton Hotel was an imposing, towering landmark in the Abuja skyline and Central District area, with that familiar name written across the building for as long as I can remember. So sad to see it gone! 😢

Though the hotel's name has changed, the restaurant's hasn't, and neither has the layout. Everything looked warmly familiar, and brought back so many wonderful memories for me! 🥰 The breakfast spread at Papillon Restaurant was impressive. There were 2 seperate HOT FOOD STATIONS that featured NIGERIAN & CONTINENTAL DISHES. For the Nigerian options there was BEANS POTTAGE, BEEF STEW, BOILED PLANTAIN, EGG STEW, FRIED FISH, FRIED RICE and GOLDEN YAM (yam dipped in eggs & fried). For the Continental choices, there was BAKED BEANS, BREAKFAST POTATOES, SAUSAGES and SAUTEED MUSHROOMS. In addition, there was a dedicated EGG STATION for  your 'tailor-made' egg orders. FRENCH TOAST, PANCAKES and WAFFLES were also available at this Egg Station, located outside by a lovely green, foliage space. 

A JUICES STATION with several Juices in attractive tumblers was available, as was a BREAD STATION featuring all kinds of BREADS, BREAD ROLLS, CROISSANTS and PASTRIES with lots of CONDIMENTS. A Toaster was available. Papillon had a SALAD STATION with COLD CUTS/MEATS, various CHEESES, FRESH SALADS, PATES, SMOKED SALMON and numerous FRESH VEGETABLES. There was a TEA/COFFEE & BEVERAGES Station too. I enjoyed about 3 full plates, (check out my posted pictures), and I must say that every dish had tons of flavour and was cooked very well! 😋 The only slight criticisms I would give the overall breakfast spread at Papillon is that the Fried Fish had too many thorny bones in it, and all the food in the Hot Food Station's chafing dishes were too hot to the point of being too dry. Maybe this was because I visited a bit late- (around 9:30a.m), when breakfast hours were almost over, so the food had been sitting in the chafing dishes for quite a while. 

I liked the fact that my Juice of choice- (orange) was brought to my table as opposed to me getting it by myself. Service at Papillon Restaurant was excellent. I interacted with ESTHER, or MADAME ESTHER, (as they fondly called her). A lady called PRECIOUS fetched my Orange Juice, and never hesitated to get me refills. Precious was very sweet. SOPHIA was also quite polite, as was DANIEL at the Egg Station. Daniel also brought my ordered eggs over to my table, and they were delicious. I loved his pretty garnish, (refer to my posted photo of it). 🤩 Daniel was a delightful fellow. The service at Papillon Restaurant was on point, no over-zealousness or that annoying pushiness that is quite commonplace in many a Nigerian Restaurant! 😄 I'd like to say a big thank you to these awesome staff members for making my experience a very pleasant one. As I mentioned earlier, I enjoyed everything about my breakfast buffet at Papillon. Except for the dried-out hot food and bony fish, I'll rank them very highly, especially because of the very professional service. At 12,500 Naira, it was well worth it/money well spent and I can't wait to be back. Very impressive breakfast buffet that I would highly, highly recommend!!! 👍🏽👏🏼👌🏽",N/A,Call,"https://maps.apple.com/maps?saddr=&daddr=1 Ladi Kwali street, Wuse Zone 4, FCT, Abuja, Abuja 900281 Nigeria@9.06428,7.48054",4.04 of 5 bubbles(4 reviews),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293825-d15117680-Reviews-Papillon_Restaurant-Abuja_Federal_Capital_Territory.html

177,Johnny Rockets,Abuja Photos,"Was very pleased to visit Johnny Rockets with over a dozen members of my family on a warm summer afternoon. This iconic, retro American restaurant franchise, known for its Burgers, Milkshakes, Hotdogs, Floats, Hand-spun Shakes, Soda Pops and Malts is quite a family-friendly and fun place to visit, in just about every country where the chain exists. There are about 3 Johnny Rockets' branches in Abuja; (maybe more). We visited the one located inside Discovery Mall, on Konoko Crescent, off Adetokunbo Ademola Street in Wuse 2. This particular branch was spread out over 2 floors. The 2nd floor was like a Sports Bar, adorned with a plethora of football (soccer) jerseys and several televisions. Everything looked clean, organised and well-maintained. Being at Johnny Rockets made me so nostalgic about when I used to live in the U.S. It brought back so many amazing memories. 🥰

 Johnny Rockets is also synonymous with trendy memorabilia from a bygone era, mostly stemming from the 1940s onwards. These include, but are not limited to- tiled black & white checkered floors, deep red vinyl, swivelling stools and diner-like counters, black & white images of models, musicians, sports figures, happy children and regular folk. Decors of large cardboard illustrations of military men and women in uniform, (mostly World War 2 armed services attire), baseball superstars and other famous athletes like Muhammad Ali and Jackie Robinson, Pepsi Cola ads, vintage 'Life' and 'Time' magazine covers, etc are popular fixtures at Johnny Rockets. A Jukebox Machine/Station was just a prop, for show, which was a big disappointment to me because I would have loved to play some classic oldies! 
 
As I previously mentioned, this classic all American Diner serves the most enduring junk food enjoyed the world over. They had 9 Burgers, 9 Shareable Starters/Sides, 11 Fan Favourites (all Sandwiches), 10 'Exciting' Extras, 4 Salads, 16 Shakes, (plus one Kid's Shake), 4 Desserts, Soda Pops (just Sodas) and 4 Flavor Shots.  You could substitute the protein on any burger at no charge. Substitutes include Chicken Breast and 100% Soy Boca Burger. Now what on earth is a Soy Boca Burger??? 🤨 Never heard of it! 😄 As there were almost 20 of us, we ordered quite a lot. 

We got the following burgers: ROCKET SINGLE & ROCKET DOUBLE (Their Signature Hamburger, includes Cheddar Cheese, Crisp Iceberg Lettuce, Fresh Tomato, Sliced Onion and Special Sauce)- we got 3 Single and 1 Double; and THE NAIJA (Crisp Iceberg Lettuce, Fresh Sliced Tomato, White Onions, Mayonnaise and our Special Blend of Suya Spices. Exclusively made for the Nigerian Market, this Hamburger is Spicy and Delicious). We ordered 4 Naijas. We also got one order of the #12 HAMBURGER (Cheddar Cheese, Crisp Iceberg Lettuce, Sliced Onion, Crinkle-Cut Pickles, Mayonnaise & our Rockin' Red Sauce, Tangy Chilli Ketchup with a kick. This Hamburger debued on Johnny Rockets opening day. On a scale of 1-10, our guests rated it a 12!).

Other Burgers ordered were the ROUTE 66 (Swiss Cheese, Grilled Mushrooms, Caramelised Onions & Mayonnaise. This favourite is named after the iconic, carefree American Highway), and THE SPICY HOUSTON (Spicy Jalapeños, Pepper Jack Cheese, Crisp Iceberg Lettuce, Fresh Tomato & our Smokin' Chipotle Ranch Sauce). We ordered 2 Route 66s and 2 Spicy Houstons. Orders for the younger members of our group included CHICKEN STRIPS (Lightly Breaded, Crispy Chicken Strips with your choice of BBQ, Ranch or Honey Mustard Dipping Sauce)- about 2, and ROCKET WINGS (Spicy Chicken Wings, served plain or tumbled in your choice of Traditional or Tangy Barbecue Sauce). 2 Rocket Wings we ordered. 

I ordered a TUNA MELT (White Albacore Tuna Salad, made fresh daily, with Melted Cheddar Cheese and grilled on your choice of White or Wheat Sliced Bread). We got a takeaway order, (for my husband), of CHICKEN CEASAR SALAD (Crisp Iceberg Lettuce, topped with a Juicy Grilled Chicken Breast, freshly grated Parmesan Cheese and our Home-Made Caesar Dressing). 9 FRIES and 2 CHEESE FRIES were gotten, plus 3 OREO MILKSHAKES and 1 VANILLA MILKSHAKE, as well as several SODAS. My # 12 Burger and Tuna Melt Sandwich turned out to be okay; nothing wow, nothing spectacular about the both of them. None of the dishes came with any pretty garnish, so everything looked rather plain and unattractive. I didn't like the fact that none of Johnny Rockets' Signature Burgers came with French Fries/Chips. You had to order these separately. I felt it should have come together, as a meal. 

Our service was decent. The food didn't take too long to emerge, and the staff were helpful and polite. I remember a guy named CHURCHILL, and a lady called GINA. It was a bit odd that they were all wearing jerseys, except for Churchill, who was the only employee who wore a Johnny Rockets uniform. Perhaps there was a reason why; maybe there was a football match later on that day/night? Just about everyone enjoyed what they ordered, with hardly any complaints. They especially liked their Milkshakes. I noticed that my niece and her nanny's Chicken Strips and Chicken Wings looked over fried. I would say it was an overall okay experience, so I would definitely consider returning to Johnny Rockets again. It was a huge letdown that they didn't have Hotdogs on the menu, which happen to be my favorite junk food! 🌭😋 Nevertheless, I did enjoy some quality family time at this Johnny Rockets, what with its cool, retro vibe and ambiance from yesteryear, and classic Fast Food options. However, the experience turns out to be just okay for me, so I wouldn't go so far as to highly recommend Johnny Rockets; maybe just a little bit! 😄",N/A,Call,"https://maps.apple.com/maps?saddr=&daddr=215 Konoko Crescent off Adetokunbo Ademola Street Wuse II, Abuja 905102 Nigeria@9.074564,7.475511",4.14.1 of 5 bubbles(109 reviews),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293825-d6953913-Reviews-Johnny_Rockets-Abuja_Federal_Capital_Territory.html

250,Silk Road Restaurant Abuja,Abuja Photos,"I visited Silk Road Restaurant for the very first time when my family and friends held a surprise 40th birthday party for me here about 3 years ago. You can read my TripAdvisor review of that lovely experience. On this trip to Abuja, I was fortunate to visit Silk Road on 2 seperate occasions- one with my husband, and one with my family to celebrate a nephew's graduation from secondary (high) school. I confused Silk Road Restaurant with 'Sinoni' Restaurant for a long time. This is because Silk Road happens to be located inside 'Sinoki' House, often referred to as Sinoki Building, so whenever you mention Sinoni- (a seperate, stand alone restaurant), it's mixed up with Silk Road Restaurant. I won't make that mistake again! Especially given the fact that I visited Sinoni Chinese Restaurant too. 

Sinoki House is a large building located in Abuja's Central Business District. Silk Road is located inside Sinoki- on the 5th floor, and the other floors appear to be office spaces. Sinoki House was unveiled and officially commissioned by the former First Lady of Nigeria, Mrs. Aisha Muhammad Buhari and former Nigerian Football Superstar, Daniel Amokachi on Saturday, 15th of December, 2018. There's a plethora of pictures and mementos of the event in and around the Sinoki Building. The decor of Silk Road has a casual and simplistic Asian vibe with attractive wooden accents, comfortable chairs covered in red, and a white & brown table spread. 

Silk Road has great, sprawling views of Abuja Metropolis, (refer to my posted photos). They have lots of private dining rooms. I had my surprise birthday party in one of those rooms, and on the visit with my family, we dined in the Shanghai Room, then with my husband, we sat in the main restaurant. Silk Road Restaurant has an extensive menu with many Chinese Classics and Favorites, including 'Claypot' options. I appreciated the fact that their menu came on/in an iPad, and they also had a hard copy menu, as opposed to accessing it via that pesky Q.R Code format, which is so annoying to me. 

On the first visit to Silk Road, my husband and I ordered the BUTTERFLY KING PRAWN CUTLETS and DEEP FRIED PRAWN SPRING ROLLS for our Starters. He got the CREAM SEAFOOD SOUP. For our Main Course, it was the FRIED PRAWNS WITH SWEET & SOUR SAUCE, STIR-FRIED YELLOW CATTLE MEAT and a SPECIAL FRIED RICE. I got the CHAPMAN for my drink. Everything tasted absolutely phenomenal, so authentic and packed full of all those wonderful flavours we know and love about Chinese Food. It's without a doubt our favourite cuisine.....by far! 😋

On the second visit, (with my extended family), we ordered the following soups: SWEET CORN SOUP WITH MINCED CHICKEN, HOT & SOUR SOUP (PEKING), SHREDDED CHICKEN WITH CRABMEAT SOUP and SEAFOOD SOUP WITH BEAN CURD; the latter being mine. For our Appetisers, we got BUTTERFLY KING PRAWNS CUTLET and DEEP FRIED PRAWN SPRING ROLLS, one per person. Those seem to be quite popular items at Silk Road! 😄 For the Mains, it was multiple plates of FRIED PRAWNS ON HOT PLATE, FRIED CHICKEN WITH SWEET & SOUR SAUCE, SHREDDED BEEF WITH GREEN PEPPER, FRIED SLICED BEEF WITH SPRING ONIONS ON HOT PLATE, FRIED CROAKER FISH FILLET IN CHILLI SAUCE, then several plates of FRIED NOODLES WITH ASSORTED VEGETABLES, SPECIAL FRIED RICE and FRIED SINGAPORE RICE NOODLES. We were a party of 13, hence the copious amount of food. The food was served with large glass pitchers of CHAPMAN. 

Unsurprisingly, our food was just as delicious as ever, like my maiden, as well as my second visit. Silk Road Restaurant has really 'got it going on' in the taste department! 😋 👏🏼 The only criticism I/we had about the food was our soup(s) tasted flat and underseasoned. My adult daughter described it as 'not well developed'! 😄 I also noticed a bunch of holes on the white table linen- (check my posted photo of one). The toilet adjoined to the 'Shanghai' Private Dining Room wasn't very clean and well-maintained. I'd also like to call their attention to the Karaoke Machine in the Shanghai Room. It wasn't working properly and had quite a limited selection of songs, most notably Micheal Jackson songs and videos, plus a few of Beyonce Knowles. Microphone kept making a screeching, ear piercing sound! 🙉

Service at Silk Road was overall okay, though I didn't get the name of any waiter because they weren't wearing name tags. I found the prices at Silk Road exorbitantly high! On our second visit- (even though there were over a dozen of us), the bill came out to over half a million Naira! 😵 This is roughly about 700 Dollars or 680 Euros!😫 The surcharge, (perhaps service charge) came out to about 50 thousand Naira, and what looked like an additional 7.50% tax fee. I know the food was good, but was it really 'that good'?!?! 🤔 I'm not so sure that these outrageous prices are justified, but that's just me! 🤷🏾‍♀️ It's a good thing I didn't pick up the tab on all 3 occasions! 😆 Nevertheless, Silk Road Restaurant ranks as my favourite Chinese Restaurant in Abuja, based on my 'trio' of 'varied/unique' experiences here. 

The food here is quite amazing, and I can think of only one other restaurant- (in Maitama), that can hold a 'slight' candle to Silk Road, and I can unequivocally say that it's just not as good what is served here. I kindly urge them to fix their Karaoke Machine, because it would have significantly added to the fun, memorable experience I had when we dined here as a family. The toilet in 'Shanghai' should be refurbished, or at the barest minimum- cleaned up. Silk Road is home to some hearty, wholesome, and simply delicious Chinese Food that everyone should endeavour to visit when in Abuja. Trust me, you won't regret it! Keep up the great job Silk Road! 😉 Highly, highly, highly recommended!!! 👏🏼👍🏽👏🏼👍🏽",N/A,Call,"https://maps.apple.com/maps?saddr=&daddr=Plot 770 Off Samuel Ademulegun Avenue Sinoki House, Opp Federal Ministry Of Transport, Central Business District, Abuja 234009 Nigeria@9.05706,7.4826",4.24.2 of 5 bubbles(18 reviews),https://www.tripadvisor.com/Restaurant_Review-g293825-d15817119-Reviews-Silk_Road_Restaurant_Abuja-Abuja_Federal_Capital_Territory.html
